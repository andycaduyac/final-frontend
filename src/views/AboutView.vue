  Everywhere we go when traveling we tend to find ourselves struggling on how and where can we settle on a nice resting place when the day sets. The most common fix we come up with is we ought to look for a hotel.
  Our team as travel enthusiasts ourselves, we go through this situation quite often as well, so we decided to create this Hotel Reservation website as a way for people to book hotel reservation conveniently at the tip of their fingers. 
  The way the system works is the customer would simply have to select the hotel, put in their personal details, select the type of room they wanna stay in, and lastly set how many days they wanna stay when they would arrive.After that, the system would send the details to the hotel's database and essentially as the name suggests, it books the reservation for them

    The team behind this system was composed of three people: <br>
